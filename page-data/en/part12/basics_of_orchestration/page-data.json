Final step is figuring a way to use a server to serve the static files. As you may know we could use our <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html\">express.static</a> with the express server to serve static files. I'll leave that as an exercise, instead we are going to go ahead and start writing our Dockerfile.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"dockerfile\"><pre class=\"language-dockerfile\"><code class=\"language-dockerfile\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>16\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> . .\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm ci\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm run build</code></pre></div>\n<p>That looks about right, let's build it and see if we are on the right track, our goal is to have the build succeed without errors.

The app will be available in <a href=\"http://localhost:5000\">http://localhost:5000</a>.</p>\n<h3>Using multiple stages</h3>\n<p>While serve is a <em>valid</em> option we can do better. With containers a good goal is to create the containers so that they do not contain anything irrelevant so that they have a small number of dependencies and are less likely to break or become vulnerable over time. </p>\n<p>Multi-stage builds are designed for splitting the build process into multiple stages. Conventional options for stages are build stage and test stage.</p>\n<p>With multi-stage builds a tried and true solution like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx\">nginx</a>, can be used to serve static files without a lot of headache. The docker hub <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx\">page for nginx</a> tells us the required info to open the ports and \"Hosting some simple static content\".</p>\n<p>Let's use the previous Dockerfile but change the FROM to include the name of the stage:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"dockerfile\"><pre class=\"language-dockerfile\"><code class=\"language-dockerfile\"><span class=\"token comment\"># The first FROM is now a stage called build-stage</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>16 AS build<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>stage\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> . .\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm ci\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm run build\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># This is a new stage, everything before this is gone, except the files we want to COPY</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> nginx<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>1.20<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>alpine\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># COPY the directory build from build-stage to /usr/share/nginx/html</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># The target location here was found from the docker hub page</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>from=build<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>stage /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now we have declared the build stage and only move the relevant files, the build directory with static content, into an image that is ready to serve the static content.</p>\n<p>The default port will be 80 for nginx, so something like <em>-p 8000:80</em> will work.</p>\n<p>Multi-stage builds also include some internal optimizations that may affect your builds. As an example, multi-stage builds skip stages that are not used. If we wish to use a stage to replace a part of a build pipeline, like testing or notifications, we must pass <strong>some</strong> data to the following stages. In some cases this is justified: copy the code from testing stage to build stage ensuring that you are building the tested code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tasks\">\n<h3>Exercises 12.12 - 12.13.</h3>\n<h4>Exercise 12.12: Todo application frontend</h4>\n<p>The following repository contains an react application in the react-app directory. Copy the contents into your own repository. The react-app directory includes a README on how to start the application.</p>\n<p><strong>TODO</strong> there is no README in app</p>\n<p>Use ENV to pass REACT<em>APP</em>BACKEND_URL to the application and run it with the backend. Backend can be running outside a container.</p>\n<h4>Exercise 12.13: Testing during build process</h4>\n<p>We can use multiple stages to do testing during the build process. The build process will fail as the tests fail.</p>\n<p>Extract a component <code class=\"language-text\">Todo</code> that represents a single todo. Write a test for the new component add run it the build process. You can add a new stage for the test if you wish to do so.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"content\">\n<h3>Developing in containers</h3>\n<p>Let's move the todo application development to a container. There are a few reasons why you would want to do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To keep the environment similar between development and production to avoid bugs that appear only in production environment</li>\n<li>To avoid differences between developers and their own environments that lead difficulties in application development</li>\n<li>To help new team members hop in by having them only be required to install container runtime</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will need to do at least two things to move the application to a container:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start the application in development mode</li>\n<li>Access the files with vscode</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And let's start with the frontend. Since the Dockerfile will be significantly different to the production Dockerfile let's create a new one called <code class=\"language-text\">dev.Dockerfile</code>.</p>\n<p>Starting the create-react-app in development mode should be easy, lets start with the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"dockerfile\"><pre class=\"language-dockerfile\"><code class=\"language-dockerfile\"><span class=\"token keyword\">FROM</span> node<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>16\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">COPY</span> . .\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># Change npm ci to npm install since we are going to be in development mode</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">RUN</span> npm install\n\n<span class=\"token comment\"># npm start is the command to start the application in development mode</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CMD</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"npm\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"start\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The flag <code class=\"language-text\">-f</code> will be used to tell which file to use, it would otherwise default to Dockerfile: <code class=\"language-text\">docker build -f ./dev.Dockerfile -t hello-front-dev .</code>. The create-react-app will be served in port 3000, so you can test that it works. </p>\n<p>The second task, Access the files with vscode, is not done yet. There are at least two ways of doing this: </p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers\">The Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension</a> </li>\n<li>Volumes, the same thing we used to preserve data with the database</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's go over the latter since not everyone is using vscode. Let's do a trial run with the flag <code class=\"language-text\">-v</code> and if that works then we will move the configuration to a docker-compose file. To use the -v we will need to tell it the current directory. pwd should do that for you, try with <code class=\"language-text\">echo $(pwd)</code>. Use that as the left side for -v to map current directory to the inside of the container.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ docker run -p 3000:3000 -v &quot;$(pwd):/usr/src/app/&quot; hello-front-dev\n\n  Compiled successfully!\n\n  You can now view hello-front in the browser.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now edit the src/App.js and the changes should be hot-loaded to the browser.</p>\n<p>Next let's move that config to a docker-compose.yml.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">services</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token key atrule\">app</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hello<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>front<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>dev\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">build</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">context</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> .\n      <span class=\"token key atrule\">dockerfile</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> dev.Dockerfile\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">volumes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> ./<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>/usr/src/app\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">ports</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> 3000<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token number\">3000</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">container_name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> hello<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>front<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>dev <span class=\"token comment\"># This will name the container hello-front-dev</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>With this <code class=\"language-text\">docker-compose up</code> can run the application in development mode. You don't even need node installed to develop it!</p>\n<p>Installing new dependencies is a headache for a development setup like this. One of the better options is to install the new dependency <strong>inside</strong> the container. So instead of doing e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">npm install axios</code>, you have to do it in the running container e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">docker exec hello-front-dev npm install axios</code>. Or add it to the package.json and run <code class=\"language-text\">docker build</code> again.</p>\n<h4>Communication between containers in a docker network</h4>\n<p>The docker-compose tool sets up a network between the containers and includes a DNS to easily connect two containers to one another. Let's add a new service to the docker-compose and we can see how the network and DNS work.</p>\n<p>Next we will add a reverse proxy to our docker-compose. A reverse proxy will be the single point of entry to our application and we can hide multiple servers behind it. The final goal will be to set both the react application and the express application behind the reverse proxy. There are multiple different options, here are some examples ordered by initial release from newer to older: Traefik, Caddy, Nginx and Apache.</p>\n<p>Let's pick Nginx, the docker hub page is <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx\">here</a>. Create a file nginx.conf in the project root and take this template for a configuration. We will need to do minor edits to have our application running:</p>\n<p><strong>nginx.conf</strong></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"conf\"><pre class=\"language-conf\"><code class=\"language-conf\"># events is required, but defaults are ok\nevents { }\n\n# A http server, listening at port 80\nhttp {\n  server {\n    listen 80;\n\n    # Requests starting with root (/) are handled\n    location / {\n      # The following 3 lines are required for the hot loading to work (websocket).\n      proxy_http_version 1.1;\n      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n      proxy_set_header Connection &#39;upgrade&#39;;\n      \n      # Requests are directed to http://localhost:3000\n      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>And next add Nginx to the docker-compose file. Add a volume as instructed in the docker hub page where the right side is <code class=\"language-text\">:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro</code>, the final ro declares that the volume will be <em>read-only</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"yml\"><pre class=\"language-yml\"><code class=\"language-yml\">  <span class=\"token key atrule\">nginx</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> nginx<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>1.20.1\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">volumes</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> ./nginx.conf<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>ro\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">ports</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span> 8080<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token number\">80</span>\n    <span class=\"token key atrule\">container_name</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> reverse<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>proxy</code></pre></div>\n<p>with that added we can run docker-compose up and see what happens.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES\na02ae58f3e8d   nginx:1.20.1      &quot;/docker-entrypoint.…&quot;   4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes   0.0.0.0:8080-&gt;80/tcp, :::8080-&gt;80/tcp       reverse-proxy\n5ee0284566b4   hello-front-dev   &quot;docker-entrypoint.s…&quot;   4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes   0.0.0.0:3000-&gt;3000/tcp, :::3000-&gt;3000/tcp   hello-front-dev</code></pre></div>\n<p>Connecting to <a href=\"http://localhost:8080\">http://localhost:8080</a> will lead to a familiar looking page with 502 status. </p>\n<p>This is because directing requests to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a> leads to nowhere as the nginx container does not have any application running in port 3000. By definition localhost refers to the current computer used to access it. With containers localhost is unique for each container, leading to the container itself.</p>\n<p>Let's test this by going inside the nginx container and using curl to send a request to the application itself:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ docker exec -it reverse-proxy bash  \n\nroot@374f9e62bfa8:/# curl http://localhost:80\n  &lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;502 Bad Gateway&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n  ...</code></pre></div>\n<p>To help us docker-compose set up a network when we ran docker-compose up and had all of the containers join the network. A DNS makes sure we can find the other container. The containers are each given two names: the service name and the container name.</p>\n<p>Since we are inside the container now we can also test the DNS! Let's curl the service name (app) in port 3000</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">root@374f9e62bfa8:/# curl http://app:3000\n  <span class=\"token doctype\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>html</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">lang</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>en<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>head</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    ...\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>meta</span>\n      <span class=\"token attr-name\">name</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>description<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n      <span class=\"token attr-name\">content</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Web site created using create-react-app<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n    ...</code></pre></div>\n<p>That is it! Let's replace the proxy_pass address in nginx.conf with that one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are still encountering 503, make sure that the create-react-app has been built first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tasks\">\n<h3>Exercises 12.14. - 12.16.</h3>\n<h4>Exercise 12.14: Setup nginx in front of todo-front</h4>\n<p>Create a development docker-compose yml with nginx and our todo react-app.</p>\n<p>You can use <em>-f</em> flag to specify a file in case you want to have multiple, e.g. <em>docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up</em></p>\n<h4>Exercise 12.15: Setup nginx in front of todo-back</h4>\n<p>Add the express-app to the development docker-compose yml in development mode.</p>\n<p>Add a new location to the nginx.conf so that requests to /api are proxied to the backend. Something like this should do the trick:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"conf\"><pre class=\"language-conf\"><code class=\"language-conf\">  server {\n    listen 80;\n\n    # Requests starting with root (/) are handled\n    location / {\n      # The following 3 lines are required for the hot loading to work (websocket).\n      proxy_http_version 1.1;\n      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n      proxy_set_header Connection &#39;upgrade&#39;;\n      \n      # Requests are directed to http://localhost:3000\n      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n    }\n\n    # Requests starting with /api are handled\n    location /api {\n      ...\n    }\n  }</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">proxy_pass</code> directive has an interesting feature with a trailing slash. As we are using the path <em>/api</em> for location but the backend application only answers in paths <em>/</em> or <em>/todos</em> we will want the <em>/api</em> to be removed from the request. In other words even though the browser will send a GET request to <em>/api/todos/1</em> we want the nginx to proxy the request to <em>/todos/1</em>.
